Vocal barks have been added, as a port from Splurt. They're disabled by default. In order to hear them, go to options and click 'Hear Vocal Barks'. Your own can be customised in character creation.

Healing springs have been reintroduced from OldRW, as a sub-feature of the Druid's grove. 
Artificers are no longer part of the mage loop.
Many, many summon changes and QoL improvements. Among them are improvements to Void Dragon loot, structure destruction, healing with their T1 planar realm equivalent and more. Summons, additionally, have skills applied to them, varying in level and dependent on origin.
Many elements of mage gameplay restored from OldRW, including all the old enchantments. Meteor Storm and Sundering Lightning also make a return at T4, for 9 spellpoints.
New enchantments, some ported from Vanderlin, some unique to us. This includes Lightning, Void Touched, Unbreaking and Chaos Storm.
