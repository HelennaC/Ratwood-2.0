Vocal barks have been added, as a port from Splurt. They're disabled by default. In order to hear them, go to options and click 'Hear Vocal Barks'. Your own can be customised in character creation.
Contracts now exist and areas have a set danger value. This is a port from Azure. Visit a bounty board in round to learn more.
